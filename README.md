# Abstract
This study aims to identify key amenities that contribute to luxury classifications in Airbnb listings. Using logistic regression, I analyzed the coefficient values of various amenities to determine their influence on luxury status. Results highlight significant amenities such as 'Air Conditioning' and 'Changing Table' with high positive coefficients, indicating their strong association with luxury properties. Conversely, some amenities, like 'Long-term stays allowed,' negatively correlate with luxury. These insights can guide property owners in enhancing their listings to attract luxury-seeking guests.
